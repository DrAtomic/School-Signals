# Signals course work 

online learning sucks, to make these past few terms more enjoyable I used jupyter to do my homework/note taking. While it still wasn't enjoyable, I ended up with a lot of notes.

## usage

just click on any file that has the `.ipynb` extension. 

functions.py has a few functions that i found useful. I completely stopped using them but it was fun creating them :)

## Disclaimer

There might be wrong things in this repo regarding signals. treat it as a shitpost

Github has a tough time rendering latex so if it looks funny and you really want to see what it is, clone the repo and pop it in jupyter-lab
